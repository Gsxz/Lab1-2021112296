The sun shone brightly over the serene sea, casting a shimmering light on the sandy shore. The gentle sea breeze rustled through the trees, creating a soothing melody. As the waves lapped against the shore, seagulls soared high in the sky, their cries echoing across the vast expanse. The beach was peppered with shells, each one a treasure to be found by the seekers of the sea's bounty.
